# My Blog
My blog website

## Features
Users can signup, post blogs, like/dislike posts, make comments, etc. This web application features REST API so that other
 applications can perform CRUD operations (authentication maybe required in some cases) on the posts made on this website. 
 Also it's not necessary to signup, people can post their content without signing up and other users who have their 
 accounts on this website can approve them.
 
 ## New features to be added
 * Markdowns to make text look more beautiful.
 * Upvote/downvote system in comment section.
 * Improve the backend logic (need to refine the "approval" system)
 * Will soon develop a desktop application using QT where the users can perform CRUD operations using it.
